# Classification of Mushroom Dataset as Poisonous or Edible

The project contains the implementation and analysis of various machine learning models for classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their features. The repo contains 7 Jupyter notebooks and 2 files with the dataset.

**Mushroom_Data_Initial_Analysis.ipynb** - Provides an initial exploration of the mushroom dataset, including handling missing data and visualizing feature and class distributions.

**Feature_Engineer_Models.ipynb** - Contains the implementation of all the models using the feature engineered data used only for comparison.

**Baseline_Systems.ipynb** - Demonstrates data preprocessing, including normalization and one-hot encoding, and the implementation of trivial systems and nearest means classifier as baseline models.

**Support_Vector_Machine.ipynb** - Contains the implementation of Support Vector Machines with linear and RBF kernels for the mushroom classification problem.

**k_Nearest_Neighbors.ipynb** - Contains the implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for the mushroom classification problem.

**Perceptron.ipynb** - Contains the implementation of the 2-class Perceptron algorithm for the mushroom classification problem.

**Multi_Layer_Perceptron.ipynb** - Contains the implementation of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm for the mushroom classification problem.

**mushroom_train.csv** - Training dataset

**mushroom_test.csv** - Test dataset
